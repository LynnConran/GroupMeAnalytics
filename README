Small project that takes data from the messaging app GroupMe and uses it to display
the differing proportions of messages from one user to the next. It would have
been used to analyze more data in more creative ways, but I stopped using GroupMe
before I finished on the project.

Skills used:
Working with an unfamiliar API
Basic data management and analysis
Filtering out useful data from an excess of data
Basic graph creation
General Python development
